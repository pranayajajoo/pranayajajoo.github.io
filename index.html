            <h2>About </h2>
            I am a Master’s student in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"> Technology Management </a>
            (2019-20) at the
            Gies College of Business, University 0f Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am currently working as a Product
            Management Intern at <a href="https://www.runawayapp.com/" target="_blank"> Runaway </a>, wheren I have
            developed a detailed
            product roadmap for
            developing a web application for a mental health initiative, and conducting weekly agile sprints for all
            stages of the SDLC
            based on user stories and monitoring product iterations. During my time at UIUC, I have been focused on
            working in various
            consulting projects and case competitions. As the runner up of the British Petroleum Professional Strategy
            Competition, I
            developed a 20-year plan to transition a developing country’s reliance from non-renewable sources to clean
            sources. As a consultant for
            <a href="https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/experience/experiential-learning/illinois-business-consulting"
                target="_blank"> Illinois Business Consulting </a>,
            I worked on standardizing pellet delivery throughout the week for a global retail grocery chain, to ensure a
            more efficient demand-based replenishment
            system by conducting data analysis on current logistics and storage data of over 70 stores.

            Prior to this, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical
            Engineering at the Veermata
            Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai.
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading books and solving the Rubik\'s cube. I spent most of time at VJTI
            conducting cubing workshops and making cube arts.
            As the head of the Rubik's Cube Mumbai Open, I organized an international cubing competition with 13
            categories and over 350 participants with collaboration with <thead>
                <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/" target="_blank"> World Cube Organization </a>.
